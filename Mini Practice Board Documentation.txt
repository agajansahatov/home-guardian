Analog input: Pins A0~A5, input values between 0~1023, indicating how many such values exist.

Digital input: Digital pins 0-13, there are only two input values: 0 and 1. When there is current passing through, it is 1, otherwise it is 0. It means yes or no.

Analog output: Pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11. The output value is between 0 and 255, which can control the intensity of the output current to achieve the effect of controlling the output of the component.

Digital output: Digital pins 0-13 can all be used as digital pins. There are only two states of 0 or 1 when output, which are used to control whether the power is on.


+5V, +3.3V: the positive pole of the power supply on the control board.
GND: The negative pole of the power supply on the control board.

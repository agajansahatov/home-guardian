This "Home Guardian" project is an IoT Smart Home Environmental Monitoring System. I used Python, Arduino and PyMata4Ex library to implement it.

Here's how you should install this:

- Install Python, PyCharm and Arduino;
- C:\Users\your-user-name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Lib\site-packages;
  Delete pymata4EX-0.1-py3.12.egg if already exists.
  If it doesn't exist, then ignore this;
- In this repository open cmd and run "python setup.py install";
- Open Arduino and install FirmataExpress library. (Need to be rewritten)
- Then select the board "Arduino Uno" and the port which your practice board connected;

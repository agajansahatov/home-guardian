This "Home Guardian" project is an IoT Smart Home Environmental Monitoring System. I used Python, Arduino and PyMata4Ex library to implement it.

Here's how you should install this:

- Install Python and Arduino;
- In this repository open cmd and run "python setup.py install";
- Open Arduino and install FirmataExpress library. (Need to be rewritten)
- Then select the board "Arduino Uno" and the port which your practice board connected;
